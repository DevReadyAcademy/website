    content: `# 📚 How I Keep Up with Software

## 👋 Intro

The software industry is really dynamic and it requires a lot of effort to keep up with the latest trends. Basically, there is no end to learning in the IT industry. One of the most important skills that a software engineer must have is the way of staying up to date with the latest updates. I'm often asked how I keep up with the trends in the field of software engineering, and how I learn new stuff. Undeniably an important part of learning is practice. I still remember Uncle Bob's quote in the Clean Coders book

> *It is not your employer's responsibility to make sure you are marketable. It is not your employer's responsibility to train you, or send you to conferences, or buy your books. These things are your responsibility. You should plan on working 60 hours a week. The first 40 are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. During this remaining 20 hours you should be reading, practising, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career.*

Saying that I thought writing a blog post will give some guidelines to people that are finding it hard to follow up with software or want to discover other alternatives of learning.

## 🎧 Podcasts

Podcasts are a great way to learn new stuff and keep up with trends. I've been listening to podcasts since I was an undergrad and it's been an important way of learning for me. I used to listen to podcasts during my commute but nowadays working remotely I will probably do it in parallel with another activity. I prefer podcasts that are less than an hour because it does not require a lot of time commitment.

## 📖 Books

Reading books seems kinda outdated. But books have been an important way of my learning process. If you want to explore a technical topic in-depth, then books are an excellent choice. Yes, the industry evolves incredibly fast, but certain books will help you explore your field of work on a much deeper level. The most influential thing throughout my career was reading Clean Code by Uncle Bob. I read that book while I was in the second year of my studies and it completely changed my mindset about software. Back then I did not know who Uncle Bob was, so after googling I learnt about Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Grady Booch, Jim Coplien and all the well-known people in the software industry. This of course helped me create a backlog of books that I had to read since some of those books are "must-reads" for all software engineers regardless of their experience.

Here is my notion page of Books that I've read or about to read soon:

![Books I've read or plan to read](/assets/blogs/how-to-keep-up/books.webp)

## 🎤 Attend Events

Conferences and meetings are an excellent way to follow new trends. Many new products and developments in the IT realm are presented at conferences and meetups. One of the most important benefits of such events is the ability to meet new people from the software industry and make valuable contacts. It's also a great way of discussing software, exchanging ideas with people that work in different domains/companies with different dynamics. Some of the events I would recommend attending are the following.

### Conferences

- [London Software Craftsmanship Conference](https://sc-london.com/)
- [VoxxedDays Athens](https://voxxeddays.com/athens/)
- [VoxxedDays Thessaloniki](https://voxxeddays.com/thessaloniki/)
- [Devoxx](https://devoxx.com/)
- [GOTO conference](https://gotopia.tech/)

### Meetups

- [Thessaloniki not-only Java Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Not-Only-Java/)
- [Thessaloníki .NET Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-NET-Meetup/)
- [Domain-Driven Design London](https://www.meetup.com/dddlondon/)
- [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/)
- [LJC - London Java Community](https://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/)
- [London Microservices](https://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices/)

I've met great people throughout my participation in those events and they helped me massively with my career progression. I feel really lucky that I had the chance to participate in such events which boosted my knowledge.

## 💪 Practice

Whenever I learn a new technology, tool, or programming language I will always use Stack Overflow to verify my knowledge and try to answer questions regarding the new topic. One of the best ways to learn something is using the Feynman Technique where you try to explain in a simple way solutions to other people's problems. Answering questions in Stack Overflow helps me a lot construct my thoughts and potentially find gaps in my explanation. A second benefit of using Stack Overflow when learning a new subject is that you can quickly get a good essence of the common issues and problems other devs are facing regarding that subject. Another good way of practising a new topic I am learning is by doing code katas.

> *A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.*

Code katas are an excellent way of practising a new tool, library, concept, programming language, or a new design technique. It's a practice session where the goal is not only to solve the problem but to practice and sharpen your skills during the process of solving it. You can find some of the katas I have solved in my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/apavlidi).

There are two websites I use for finding katas:

- [Katalyst](https://katalyst.codurance.com/)
- [CodingDojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/)

One thing to note here is that pairing is extremely useful when solving code katas or working on side project. I strongly recommend working on a team so you can share tips, resources and experience.

## 🎓 Online Courses

Software is an industry where most of the information is publicly available through the internet. There are a huge number of tutorials that can help you learn new stuff. Tutorials are a great way of learning by doing, which for me is an effective technique of learning. Online education is really popular in our industry due to its low cost, and time-saving advantages. Besides, experience beats theory most of the time - so combining both is probably a more effective way of learning. These are the platforms I am using:

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
- [Oreilly](https://www.oreilly.com/)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)

Youtube has a lot of good tutorials as well but compared to the above mentions the quality on average is much lower but there are exceptions.

## 📝 Have a Plan

Keeping up with software is certainly a hard task. Things do change constantly at a fast pace. The amount of information we as software engineers consume every day is huge and keeping track of everything is really difficult. Having a plan or a list of topics you want to learn can be quite helpful. I've been using tools as my second brain to help me structure all this information. To be honest I had a hard time finding a good tool to fulfil that purpose. I used Trello, Asana, Miro, Google Keep, Evernote but nothing quite worked for me.

Last 3 months I've been using Notion as my second brain tool and it's been an awesome experience. Notion has components for notes, kanban boards, wikis, databases, calendars etc. By connecting those components you can create systems for knowledge, data and project management. Here you can see my dashboard for the software section. I have subpages to each one of those pages but you probably get the idea. Everything new that I might need to read later, will go to the Reading List. If I have an idea of a project, or a blog post it will add that to Ideas and so forth.

![My Notion dashboard](/assets/blogs/how-to-keep-up/dashboard.webp)

Another useful resource I used throughout the years is the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). It's been a great guide for me to pick up the next topic I want to learn especially when I was more junior and I was overwhelmed by all the different topics under the software umbrella.

## 🔗 Other Ways of Following Trends

The following list is resources that I don't heavily rely on and it's more like optional ways for me for learning new stuff.

- Surveys - Surveys are great for giving you insights into the trends in software. In my opinion [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/) is by far the best one related to software.
- Follow People that Talk about Tech
- [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)
- Newsletters: [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [TLDR](https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/)
- Certifications: [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)
- Competitions: [HashCode](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/), [IEEEXtreme](https://ieeextreme.org/)

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

The world of IT is changing regularly and hence you have to evolve as IT evolves. Staying ahead of the competition and on top of your game requires a formidable effort. A final suggestion would be to read, practice, repeat.

    contentGr: `# 📚 Πώς Παρακολουθώ τις Εξελίξεις στο Software

## 👋 Εισαγωγή

Ο κλάδος του software είναι πραγματικά δυναμικός και απαιτεί πολλή προσπάθεια για να παρακολουθείς τις τελευταίες τάσεις. Βασικά, δεν υπάρχει τέλος στη μάθηση στον κλάδο της πληροφορικής. Μία από τις πιο σημαντικές δεξιότητες που πρέπει να έχει ένας software engineer είναι ο τρόπος με τον οποίο παραμένει ενημερωμένος με τις τελευταίες εξελίξεις. Συχνά με ρωτούν πώς παρακολουθώ τις τάσεις στον τομέα του software engineering και πώς μαθαίνω νέα πράγματα. Αναμφισβήτητα, ένα σημαντικό μέρος της μάθησης είναι η πρακτική εξάσκηση. Θυμάμαι ακόμα το quote του Uncle Bob στο βιβλίο Clean Coders

> *Δεν είναι ευθύνη του εργοδότη σου να σε κάνει ελκυστικό στην αγορά εργασίας. Δεν είναι ευθύνη του εργοδότη σου να σε εκπαιδεύσει, να σε στείλει σε συνέδρια ή να σου αγοράσει βιβλία. Αυτά είναι δική σου ευθύνη. Πρέπει να σχεδιάζεις να δουλεύεις 60 ώρες την εβδομάδα. Οι πρώτες 40 είναι για τον εργοδότη σου. Οι υπόλοιπες 20 είναι για σένα. Κατά τη διάρκεια αυτών των 20 ωρών πρέπει να διαβάζεις, να εξασκείσαι, να μαθαίνεις και να βελτιώνεις την καριέρα σου.*

Λέγοντας αυτό, σκέφτηκα ότι το να γράψω ένα blog post θα δώσει κάποιες κατευθύνσεις σε ανθρώπους που δυσκολεύονται να ακολουθούν τις εξελίξεις στο software ή θέλουν να ανακαλύψουν εναλλακτικούς τρόπους μάθησης.

## 🎧 Podcasts

Τα podcasts είναι ένας εξαιρετικός τρόπος για να μαθαίνεις νέα πράγματα και να παρακολουθείς τις τάσεις. Ακούω podcasts από τότε που ήμουν φοιτητής και έχει αποτελέσει σημαντικό τρόπο μάθησης για μένα. Συνήθιζα να ακούω podcasts κατά τη διάρκεια κάποιου commute, αλλά τώρα που δουλεύω απομακρυσμένα πιθανότατα θα το κάνω παράλληλα με κάποια άλλη δραστηριότητα. Προτιμώ podcasts που διαρκούν λιγότερο από μία ώρα γιατί δεν απαιτούν μεγάλη δέσμευση χρόνου.

## 📖 Βιβλία

Η ανάγνωση βιβλίων φαίνεται κάπως ξεπερασμένη. Αλλά τα βιβλία έχουν αποτελέσει σημαντικό μέρος της διαδικασίας μάθησής μου. Αν θέλεις να εξερευνήσεις ένα τεχνικό θέμα σε βάθος, τότε τα βιβλία είναι μια εξαιρετική επιλογή. Ναι, ο κλάδος εξελίσσεται απίστευτα γρήγορα, αλλά ορισμένα βιβλία θα σε βοηθήσουν να εξερευνήσεις τον τομέα εργασίας σου σε πολύ βαθύτερο επίπεδο. Το αγαπημένο μου βιβλίο είναι το Clean Code του Uncle Bob. Διάβασα αυτό το βιβλίο όταν ήμουν στο δεύτερο έτος των σπουδών μου και άλλαξε εντελώς τη νοοτροπία μου για το software. Τότε δεν ήξερα ποιος ήταν ο Uncle Bob, οπότε μετά από googling έμαθα για τον Martin Fowler, τον Kent Beck, τον Grady Booch, τον Jim Coplien και όλους τους γνωστούς ανθρώπους στον κλάδο του software. Αυτό φυσικά με βοήθησε να δημιουργήσω ένα backlog από βιβλία που έπρεπε να διαβάσω, καθώς ορισμένα από αυτά τα βιβλία είναι "must-reads" για όλους τους software engineers ανεξάρτητα από την εμπειρία τους.

Εδώ είναι η σελίδα μου στο Notion με τα Βιβλία που έχω διαβάσει ή πρόκειται να διαβάσω σύντομα:

![Βιβλία που έχω διαβάσει ή σχεδιάζω να διαβάσω](/assets/blogs/how-to-keep-up/books.webp)

## 🎤 Συμμετοχή σε Events

Τα συνέδρια και τα meetups είναι ένας εξαιρετικός τρόπος για να παρακολουθείς νέες τάσεις. Πολλά νέα προϊόντα και εξελίξεις στον τομέα της πληροφορικής παρουσιάζονται σε συνέδρια και meetups. Ένα από τα πιο σημαντικά οφέλη τέτοιων events είναι η δυνατότητα να γνωρίσεις νέους ανθρώπους από τον κλάδο του software και να δημιουργήσεις connections. Είναι επίσης ένας εξαιρετικός τρόπος για να συζητάς για software, να ανταλλάσσεις ιδέες με ανθρώπους που δουλεύουν σε διαφορετικούς τομείς/εταιρείες με διαφορετικές δυναμικές. Μερικά από τα events που θα πρότεινα να παρακολουθήσεις είναι τα εξής.

### Συνέδρια

- [London Software Craftsmanship Conference](https://sc-london.com/)
- [VoxxedDays Athens](https://voxxeddays.com/athens/)
- [VoxxedDays Thessaloniki](https://voxxeddays.com/thessaloniki/)
- [Devoxx](https://devoxx.com/)
- [GOTO conference](https://gotopia.tech/)

### Meetups

- [Thessaloniki not-only Java Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Not-Only-Java/)
- [Thessaloníki .NET Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-NET-Meetup/)
- [Domain-Driven Design London](https://www.meetup.com/dddlondon/)
- [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/)
- [LJC - London Java Community](https://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/)
- [London Microservices](https://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices/)

Έχω γνωρίσει υπέροχους ανθρώπους μέσα από τη συμμετοχή μου σε αυτά τα events και με βοήθησαν τεράστια με την εξέλιξη της καριέρας μου. Νιώθω πολύ τυχερός που είχα την ευκαιρία να συμμετάσχω σε τέτοια events που ενίσχυσαν τις γνώσεις μου.

## 💪 Practice

Κάθε φορά που μαθαίνω μια νέα τεχνολογία, εργαλείο ή γλώσσα προγραμματισμού, θα χρησιμοποιώ πάντα το Stack Overflow για να επαληθεύσω τις γνώσεις μου και να προσπαθήσω να απαντήσω ερωτήσεις σχετικά με το νέο θέμα. Ένας από τους καλύτερους τρόπους για να μάθεις κάτι είναι να χρησιμοποιήσεις την Τεχνική Feynman όπου προσπαθείς να εξηγήσεις με απλό τρόπο λύσεις στα προβλήματα άλλων ανθρώπων. Το να απαντάω ερωτήσεις στο Stack Overflow με βοηθάει πολύ να δομώ τις σκέψεις μου και ενδεχομένως να βρίσκω κενά στην εξήγησή μου. Ένα δεύτερο όφελος της χρήσης του Stack Overflow όταν μαθαίνεις ένα νέο θέμα είναι ότι μπορείς γρήγορα να αποκτήσεις μια καλή αίσθηση των κοινών προβλημάτων που αντιμετωπίζουν άλλοι developers σχετικά με αυτό το θέμα. Ένας άλλος καλός τρόπος εξάσκησης σε ένα νέο θέμα που μαθαίνω είναι κάνοντας code katas.

> *Ένα code kata είναι μια άσκηση στον προγραμματισμό που βοηθάει τους προγραμματιστές να ακονίσουν τις δεξιότητές τους μέσω πρακτικής και επανάληψης.*

Τα code katas είναι ένας εξαιρετικός τρόπος εξάσκησης σε ένα νέο εργαλείο, βιβλιοθήκη, concept, γλώσσα προγραμματισμού ή μια νέα τεχνική σχεδίασης. Είναι ένα practicing exercise όπου ο στόχος δεν είναι μόνο να λύσεις το πρόβλημα αλλά να εξασκηθείς και να ακονίσεις τις δεξιότητές σου κατά τη διαδικασία επίλυσής του. Μπορείς να βρεις μερικά από τα katas που έχω λύσει στον GitHub λογαριασμό μου [εδώ](https://github.com/apavlidi).

Υπάρχουν δύο ιστοσελίδες που χρησιμοποιώ για να βρίσκω katas:

- [Katalyst](https://katalyst.codurance.com/)
- [CodingDojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/)

Ένα πράγμα που πρέπει να σημειωθεί εδώ είναι ότι το pairing είναι εξαιρετικά χρήσιμο όταν λύνεις code katas ή δουλεύεις σε side project. Συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα να δουλεύεις σε ομάδα ώστε να μπορείς να μοιράζεσαι tips, resources και εμπειρία.

## 🎓 Online Courses

Το software είναι ένας κλάδος όπου οι περισσότερες πληροφορίες είναι δημόσια διαθέσιμες μέσω του internet. Υπάρχει τεράστιος αριθμός tutorials που μπορούν να σε βοηθήσουν να μάθεις νέα πράγματα. Τα tutorials είναι ένας εξαιρετικός τρόπος μάθησης μέσω πράξης, που για μένα είναι μια αποτελεσματική τεχνική μάθησης. Η online εκπαίδευση είναι πολύ δημοφιλής στον κλάδο μας λόγω του χαμηλού κόστους και των πλεονεκτημάτων εξοικονόμησης χρόνου. Εξάλλου, η εμπειρία ξεπερνά τη θεωρία τις περισσότερες φορές - οπότε ο συνδυασμός και των δύο είναι πιθανώς ένας πιο αποτελεσματικός τρόπος μάθησης. Αυτές είναι οι πλατφόρμες που χρησιμοποιώ:

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
- [Oreilly](https://www.oreilly.com/)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)

Το Youtube έχει επίσης πολλά καλά tutorials, αλλά σε σύγκριση με τα παραπάνω η ποιότητα κατά μέσο όρο είναι πολύ χαμηλότερη, αλλά υπάρχουν εξαιρέσεις.

## 📝 You Need a Plan

Το να παρακολουθείς τις εξελίξεις στο software είναι σίγουρα δύσκολο. Τα πράγματα αλλάζουν συνεχώς με γρήγορο ρυθμό. Ο όγκος πληροφοριών που καταναλώνουμε ως software engineers κάθε μέρα είναι τεράστιος και η παρακολούθηση όλων είναι πραγματικά δύσκολη. Το να έχεις ένα πλάνο ή μια λίστα θεμάτων που θέλεις να μάθεις μπορεί να είναι αρκετά χρήσιμο. Χρησιμοποιώ εργαλεία ως second brain μου για να με βοηθήσουν να δομήσω όλες αυτές τις πληροφορίες. Για να είμαι ειλικρινής, δυσκολεύτηκα να βρω ένα καλό εργαλείο για αυτόν τον σκοπό. Χρησιμοποίησα Trello, Asana, Miro, Google Keep, Evernote αλλά τίποτα δεν λειτούργησε πραγματικά για μένα.

Τα τελευταία 5 χρόνια χρησιμοποιώ το Notion ως second brain tool και ήταν μια φανταστική εμπειρία. Το Notion έχει components για σημειώσεις, kanban boards, wikis, βάσεις δεδομένων, ημερολόγια κ.λπ. Συνδυάζοντας αυτά τα components μπορείς να δημιουργήσεις συστήματα για διαχείριση γνώσης, δεδομένων και projects. Εδώ μπορείς να δεις το dashboard μου για την ενότητα software. Έχω subpages σε κάθε ένα από αυτά τα pages, you get the idea. Οτιδήποτε νέο που μπορεί να χρειαστεί να διαβάσω αργότερα, θα πάει στο Reading List. Αν έχω μια ιδέα για project ή blog post, θα το προσθέσω στο Ideas κ.ο.κ.

![Το Notion dashboard μου](/assets/blogs/how-to-keep-up/dashboard.webp)

Ένας άλλος χρήσιμος πόρος που χρησιμοποίησα κατά τη διάρκεια των ετών είναι το [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). Ήταν ένας εξαιρετικός οδηγός για να επιλέξω το επόμενο θέμα που θέλω να μάθω, ειδικά όταν ήμουν πιο junior και ήμουν overwhelmed από όλα τα διαφορετικά θέματα κάτω από την ομπρέλα του software.

## 🔗 Other Ways

Η παρακάτω λίστα περιέχει resources στα οποία δεν βασίζομαι heavily και είναι περισσότερο σαν προαιρετικοί τρόποι για μένα για να μαθαίνω νέα πράγματα.

- Surveys - Τα surveys είναι εξαιρετικά για να σου δίνουν insights στις τάσεις του software. Κατά τη γνώμη μου το [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/) είναι μακράν το καλύτερο που σχετίζεται με το software.
- Ακολούθησε Ανθρώπους που Μιλούν για Tech

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Ο κόσμος της πληροφορικής αλλάζει τακτικά και επομένως πρέπει να εξελίσσεσαι όπως εξελίσσεται η πληροφορική. Το να μένεις μπροστά από τον ανταγωνισμό και στην κορυφή απαιτεί τρομερή προσπάθεια. Ένα τελευταίο note είναι: read, practice, repeat.

    content: `# 💼 Software Interviews - Dos & Donts

## 👋 Intro

I've done more than 400 interviews and interviewed more than 300 engineers in various roles, from junior to staff engineers throughout my career. Last year I found myself coaching many people in my network regarding interviews, so I thought I could write a blog post about it. The idea of the blog post is to give you summarized information of what interviews look like in software engineering and what you should and shouldn't do to increase your chance of passing your interviews. Every company does this differently, and the difficulty level also differs based on the position. I will focus on general notes that do apply everywhere unless mentioned otherwise.

## 🗣️ Behavioural

A behavioral interview focuses on questions that allow candidates to reflect and share their past professional behavior. The interviewer uses this interview technique to determine a professional's skills, personality, and capabilities. They are also known as \`Value Assessment\` or \`Cultural Interview\`.

The following questions are some behavioral questions that you could be asked

- When was the last time you received constructive feedback?
- Tell me an example of a conflict you had with a colleague, and how did you manage to solve it?
- Give me an example of where your decision influenced the end-user?
- Tell me a challenge you had, where the best way forward was not clear cut. How did you decide what to do?

For more junior people or undergrads, there is a high chance that these questions could be around a hypothetical scenario, for example, \`What would you do if you identified an issue in X?\`. That's not a rule, and it could happen to more senior people, but since more junior people have less experience, the interview will try to extract the information given a context.

## 💻 Technical

Technical interviews are designed to assess your problem-solving abilities and how you approach the presented problem itself. Those kinds of interviews can vary. Below I listed the most common ones you might face during your interview process.

- Verbal technical questions
- Algorithmics
- Take-home project
- Pair programming
- System design
- A combination of the above mentioned, e.g., Verbal technical questions & algorithmics

These also depend on the seniority level. For example, system design is not appropriate for a junior position. It tends to be common from mid to more senior positions.

## ✅ Dos & Donts

### 😊 Good vibes

Interviews are not only about you. Try to make their time joyful. I mean, they are already investing time to interview you, and leaving a good taste when the interview finishes is really important.

### ❓ Ask!

Always ask questions! These are free points and shows interest in the employer. You can do some research about the company before your interview.
There are different kinds of questions you can ask

1. Genuine Questions - That you actually want to know the answer
   - _What are the roles within the team?_
2. Insightful Questions - Demonstrate your knowledge or understanding of technology
   - _Why for product A you choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol?_
3. Passion Questions - Demonstrate your passion for technology
   - _I'm not familiar with technology X, but sounds interesting. Can you please tell me a bit more?_

### ⭐ Use STAR/PAR technique

The STAR technique is a common system used to answer behavioral interview questions. It provides a structure for you to remember to include the correct data in your answers.

- **S** – **Situation** - background info
- **T** – **Task** - what you had to do
- **A** – **Activity** - what you did - this should be the longest part of the answer
- **R** – **Results** - positive; quantifiable; what you learned; what you would do differently next time

If you get asked a behavioral question, answer by going through the letters in order.
The PAR technique is the same as STAR but combines the S and the T steps.

### 👥 "We" vs "I"

When answering questions about your experience, you should try balancing your answers by using both _we_ and _I_. Using the _we_ in an answer shows that you are a team player and you are an active member of the team. On the other hand, using _I_ will show that you are taking more initiatives and will show off your leadership skills. Answering with only one of those subject pronouns will not have good results because you are either not self-independent or are not a team player. It's pretty essential to give both perspectives to the interviewer.

### 🤷 It's ok to say "I don't know"

Don't lie in things that you cannot support. If you get asked about a specific technology that you don't know or never heard of, don't lie! Professional interviewers will eventually find out, and you will possibly get rejected. It's totally fine not to know some stuff; honesty is not harmful. One suggestion is to show some interest in things you don't know and ask for more details about the subject if there is time.

### 📖 Prepare your stories

Prepare some examples of challenges, conflicts, failures, leadership in your work experience or projects so that you can have something to talk about. It's challenging to improvise in the interview in real-time.
This is a table I think I've taken from the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=56176823187&hvadid=259151807165&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1006886&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14006929763397277600&hvtargid=kwd-297264693965&hydadcr=17616_1817786&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1645058943&sr=8-1) book where it can be helpful.

| Questions                 | Project 1 | Project 2 |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Challenges                | ...       | ...       |
| Mistakes/Failures         | ...       | ...       |
| Enjoyed                   | ...       | ...       |
| Leadership                | ...       | ...       |
| What you'd do differently | ...       | ...       |

### 📝 Take notes

After finishing the interview, write down everything that happened. This is helping me with my self-assessment to have a better understanding of my performance. It is also helpful in your next or upcoming interviews. Of course, you can always ask for feedback, but not all companies take the time to give you any.

### 🎭 Mock interviews

Mock interviews are an ideal way to practice for real job interviews because you are in a situation that mirrors an actual interview with a company. When you review your interview with the interviewer, you'll be able to modify your responses and interview behavior, if necessary. Practice interviews familiarize you with the interview process and allow you to practice answering common interview questions with confidence. Some platforms offer this as a service, but you can always find a friend to help you out.

### 💪 Perseverance

There would be times when the problem you asked to solve might be complex, or there is no straightforward solution. You always have to demonstrate perseverance! Perseverance is determining to keep on going in the face of setbacks and challenges. When you are stuck, don't give up. Keep trying to solve the problem, and that will show off your grit and independence.

### 🎉 Enjoy it!

I find interviews really challenging, and it's fascinating to me. It's almost like having exams within your career. I know that it can get frustrating and stressful, but I think it will certainly pay off if you put in the effort.

## 🎯 Wrap up

In this blog, I discussed different types of interviews and shared some of my learnings after so many interviews, along with techniques and tips that I use to help me perform better.

    contentGr: `# 💼 Software Interviews - Dos & Donts

## 👋 Εισαγωγή

Έχω κάνει πάνω από 400 interviews και έχω πάρει interview σε περισσότερους από 300 engineers σε διάφορους ρόλους, από junior έως staff engineers στην καριέρα μου. Πέρυσι βρέθηκα να κάνω coach πολλούς ανθρώπους στο δίκτυό μου σχετικά με interviews, οπότε σκέφτηκα να γράψω ένα blog post γι' αυτό. Η ιδέα του blog post είναι να σου δώσω συνοπτικές πληροφορίες για το πώς είναι τα interviews στο software engineering και τι πρέπει και τι δεν πρέπει να κάνεις για να αυξήσεις την πιθανότητα να περάσεις τα interviews σου. Κάθε εταιρεία το κάνει διαφορετικά και το επίπεδο δυσκολίας διαφέρει ανάλογα με τη θέση. Θα εστιάσω σε γενικές σημειώσεις που ισχύουν παντού, εκτός αν αναφέρεται διαφορετικά.

## 🗣️ Behavioural

Ένα behavioral interview εστιάζει σε ερωτήσεις που επιτρέπουν στους υποψηφίους να αναστοχαστούν και να μοιραστούν την προηγούμενη επαγγελματική τους συμπεριφορά. Ο interviewer χρησιμοποιεί αυτή την τεχνική interview για να προσδιορίσει τα skills, την προσωπικότητα και τις ικανότητες ενός επαγγελματία. Είναι επίσης γνωστά ως \`Value Assessment\` ή \`Cultural Interview\`.

Οι παρακάτω ερωτήσεις είναι μερικές behavioral ερωτήσεις που μπορεί να σου γίνουν:

- Πότε ήταν η τελευταία φορά που έλαβες constructive feedback?
- Πες μου ένα παράδειγμα σύγκρουσης που είχες με συνάδελφο και πώς κατάφερες να το λύσεις?
- Δώσε μου ένα παράδειγμα όπου η απόφασή σου επηρέασε τον τελικό χρήστη?
- Πες μου μια πρόκληση που είχες, όπου ο καλύτερος τρόπος δεν ήταν ξεκάθαρος. Πώς αποφάσισες τι να κάνεις?

Για πιο junior ανθρώπους ή undergrads, υπάρχει μεγάλη πιθανότητα αυτές οι ερωτήσεις να είναι γύρω από ένα υποθετικό σενάριο, για παράδειγμα, \`Τι θα έκανες αν εντόπιζες ένα πρόβλημα στο X;\`. Αυτό δεν είναι κανόνας και μπορεί να συμβεί σε πιο senior ανθρώπους, αλλά επειδή οι πιο junior άνθρωποι έχουν λιγότερη εμπειρία, το interview θα προσπαθήσει να εξαγάγει την πληροφορία δίνοντας ένα context.

## 💻 Technical

Τα technical interviews είναι σχεδιασμένα να αξιολογήσουν τις problem-solving ικανότητές σου και πώς προσεγγίζεις το πρόβλημα που παρουσιάζεται. Αυτά τα είδη interviews μπορεί να ποικίλλουν. Η παρακάτω λίστα περιέχει τα πιο συνηθισμένα που μπορεί να αντιμετωπίσεις κατά τη διαδικασία του interview σου:

- Verbal technical questions
- Algorithmics
- Take-home project
- Pair programming
- System design
- Συνδυασμός των παραπάνω, π.χ., Verbal technical questions & algorithmics

Αυτά εξαρτώνται επίσης από το seniority level. Για παράδειγμα, το system design δεν είναι κατάλληλο για junior θέση. Τείνει να είναι συνηθισμένο από mid έως πιο senior θέσεις.

## ✅ Dos & Donts

### 😊 Good vibes

Τα interviews δεν είναι μόνο για σένα. Προσπάθησε να κάνεις τον χρόνο των interviewer ευχάριστο. Ήδη επενδύουν χρόνο για να σε πάρουν interview, οπότε το να αφήσεις μια καλή εντύπωση όταν τελειώσει το interview είναι πολύ σημαντικό.

### ❓ Ask!

Πάντα κάνε ερωτήσεις! Αυτά είναι free points και δείχνουν ενδιαφέρον για τον εργοδότη. Μπορείς να κάνεις λίγη έρευνα για την εταιρεία πριν το interview σου.
Υπάρχουν διαφορετικά είδη ερωτήσεων που μπορείς να κάνεις:

1. Genuine Questions - Που πραγματικά θέλεις να ξέρεις την απάντηση
   - _Ποιοι είναι οι ρόλοι μέσα στην ομάδα;_
2. Insightful Questions - Δείχνουν τη γνώση σου ή την κατανόησή σου της τεχνολογίας
   - _Γιατί για το προϊόν A επιλέξατε να χρησιμοποιήσετε το X protocol αντί του Y protocol;_
3. Passion Questions - Δείχνουν το πάθος σου για την τεχνολογία
   - _Δεν γνωρίζω την τεχνολογία X, αλλά ακούγεται ενδιαφέρουσα. Μπορείτε να μου πείτε λίγα περισσότερα;_

### ⭐ Use STAR/PAR technique

Η STAR τεχνική είναι ένα κοινό σύστημα που χρησιμοποιείται για να απαντήσεις behavioral interview ερωτήσεις. Παρέχει μια δομή για να θυμάσαι να συμπεριλάβεις τα σωστά δεδομένα στις απαντήσεις σου.

- **S** – **Situation** - background info
- **T** – **Task** - τι έπρεπε να κάνεις
- **A** – **Activity** - τι έκανες - αυτό πρέπει να είναι το μεγαλύτερο μέρος της απάντησης
- **R** – **Results** - positive; quantifiable; τι έμαθες; τι θα έκανες διαφορετικά την επόμενη φορά

Αν σου κάνουν μια behavioral ερώτηση, απάντα περνώντας από τα γράμματα με τη σειρά.

### 👥 "We" vs "I"

Όταν απαντάς ερωτήσεις για την εμπειρία σου, πρέπει να προσπαθήσεις να ισορροπήσεις τις απαντήσεις σου χρησιμοποιώντας και _we_ και _I_. Το _we_ σε μια απάντηση δείχνει ότι είσαι team player και ότι είσαι ενεργό μέλος της ομάδας. Από την άλλη, το _I_ θα δείξει ότι παίρνεις περισσότερες πρωτοβουλίες και θα δείξει τα leadership skills σου. Το να απαντάς με μόνο μία από αυτές τις αντωνυμίες δεν θα έχει καλά αποτελέσματα γιατί είτε δεν είσαι self-independent είτε δεν είσαι team player. Είναι πολύ σημαντικό να δώσεις και τις δύο προοπτικές στον interviewer.

### 🤷 It's ok to say "I don't know"

Μην λες ψέματα σε πράγματα που δεν μπορείς να υποστηρίξεις. Αν σε ρωτήσουν για μια συγκεκριμένη τεχνολογία που δεν ξέρεις ή δεν έχεις ακούσει ποτέ, μην πεις ψέματα! Professional interviewers τελικά θα το καταλάβουν και πιθανώς θα απορριφθείς. Είναι εντάξει να μην ξέρεις κάποια πράγματα. Η ειλικρίνεια δεν είναι επιβλαβής. Μια πρόταση είναι να δείξεις ενδιαφέρον για πράγματα που δεν ξέρεις και να ζητήσεις περισσότερες λεπτομέρειες για το θέμα αν υπάρχει χρόνος.

### 📖 Prepare your stories

Ετοίμασε μερικά παραδείγματα challenges, conflicts, failures, leadership στην εργασιακή σου εμπειρία ή projects έτσι ώστε να έχεις κάτι να πεις. Είναι δύσκολο να αυτοσχεδιάσεις στο interview σε real-time.
Ο παρακάτω πίνακας είναι εμπνευσμένος από το βιβλίο [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=56176823187&hvadid=259151807165&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1006886&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14006929763397277600&hvtargid=kwd-297264693965&hydadcr=17616_1817786&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1645058943&sr=8-1) και μπορεί να σε βοηθήσει στην προετοιμασία σου.

| Ερωτήσεις                 | Project 1 | Project 2 |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Challenges                | ...       | ...       |
| Mistakes/Failures         | ...       | ...       |

| Τι θα έκανες διαφορετικά  | ...       | ...       |

### 📝 Take notes

Αφού τελειώσει το interview, γράψε τα πάντα που έγιναν. Αυτό με βοηθάει με την self-assessment μου για να έχω καλύτερη κατανόηση της απόδοσής μου. Είναι επίσης χρήσιμο στα επόμενα ή μελλοντικά σου interviews. Φυσικά, μπορείς πάντα να ζητήσεις feedback, αλλά δεν παίρνουν όλες οι εταιρείες τον χρόνο να σου δώσουν.

### 🎭 Mock interviews

Τα mock interviews είναι ιδανικός τρόπος για να εξασκηθείς για πραγματικά job interviews γιατί είσαι σε μια κατάσταση που αντικατοπτρίζει ένα πραγματικό interview με μια εταιρεία. Όταν κάνεις review το interview σου με τον interviewer, θα μπορέσεις να τροποποιήσεις τις απαντήσεις σου και την interview συμπεριφορά σου, αν είναι απαραίτητο. Τα mock interviews σε εξοικειώνουν με τη διαδικασία του interview και σου επιτρέπουν να εξασκηθείς απαντώντας συνηθισμένες interview ερωτήσεις με αυτοπεποίθηση. Μερικές πλατφόρμες προσφέρουν αυτό ως υπηρεσία, αλλά μπορείς πάντα να βρεις έναν φίλο να σε βοηθήσει.

### 💪 Perseverance

Θα υπάρχουν στιγμές που το πρόβλημα που σου ζητείται να λύσεις μπορεί να είναι complex ή να μην υπάρχει straightforward λύση. Πρέπει πάντα να δείχνεις perseverance! Perseverance είναι η αποφασιστικότητα να συνεχίσεις να προχωράς απέναντι σε δυσκολίες και προκλήσεις. Όταν κολλήσεις, μην τα παρατάς. Συνέχισε να προσπαθείς να λύσεις το πρόβλημα και αυτό θα δείξει το grit και την ανεξαρτησία σου.

### 🎉 Enjoy it!

Βρίσκω τα interviews πραγματικά challenging και είναι fascinating για μένα. Είναι σχεδόν σαν να έχεις εξετάσεις μέσα στην καριέρα σου. Ξέρω ότι μπορεί να γίνει frustrating και stressful, αλλά νομίζω σίγουρα θα αποδώσει αν βάλεις τον κόπο.

# From Student to Software Engineer: The Real Journey

If you're a computer science student or recent graduate in Greece, you've probably noticed something: **your degree isn't enough**.

You can solve algorithms. You understand data structures. You've passed your exams. But when you look at job postings from companies abroad—or even great Greek tech companies—you realize something is missing.

## The Gap Nobody Talks About

Universities teach you **computer science**. The industry needs **software engineering**.

Here's what I mean:

### What University Teaches:
- Algorithms and complexity
- Theoretical foundations
- Academic problem-solving
- Individual assignments

### What Industry Needs:
- Building production systems
- Working with existing codebases
- Team collaboration
- Git, CI/CD, testing
- Communication skills

**The gap is real.** And most students discover it the hard way—after dozens of rejections.

## My Story

I graduated with good grades. I could solve LeetCode mediums. I thought I was ready.

**I was wrong.**

My first 20 applications? Rejections. I didn't even understand why.

Then I realized: I knew how to code, but I didn't know how to **engineer**.

- I didn't know how to structure a real project
- My GitHub looked like a graveyard of half-finished tutorials
- I couldn't explain my work in interviews
- I had no portfolio that demonstrated real skills

So I spent 6 months learning the hard way:
- Built a real project (not a todo app)
- Learned Git properly
- Practiced system design
- Rewrote my CV 15 times
- Mock interviewed with friends

**Then everything changed.** Within 2 months, I had 3 offers from companies in London.

## What Actually Matters

After working in the industry and mentoring 50+ developers, here's what I've learned:

### 1. Build Real Projects
Not tutorials. Not courses. **Real projects** that solve real problems.

Your GitHub should show:
- Production-quality code
- Proper project structure
- Tests
- Documentation
- Deployed applications

### 2. Master the Fundamentals
Not theory—**engineering fundamentals**:
- How to structure code
- How to work with APIs
- How to debug effectively
- How to use Git in a team
- How to write tests

### 3. Learn to Communicate
Tech interviews aren't coding tests. They're **conversations**.

You need to:
- Explain your thinking process
- Ask clarifying questions
- Discuss trade-offs
- Collaborate on solutions

### 4. Build Your Brand
Companies don't just hire skills—they hire **people**.

Your online presence matters:
- Professional GitHub
- Well-written CV
- LinkedIn that tells your story
- Portfolio that showcases your work

## The Path Forward

Here's the truth: **you don't need another program that teaches you React**.

You need:
- **Structured guidance** on what to build
- **Real feedback** on your code and projects
- **Industry mentorship** from people who've been there
- **Interview preparation** that actually works

That's why we built DevReady.

## What You Can Do Today

1. **Pick ONE project** and build it properly
2. **Push to GitHub** daily
3. **Apply to 5 companies** (even if you feel "not ready")
4. **Connect with engineers** on LinkedIn
5. **Share your progress** publicly

The journey from student to engineer isn't easy. But it's absolutely possible.

**You don't need to be perfect. You need to be ready.**

# Από Φοιτητής σε Software Engineer: Το Πραγματικό Ταξίδι

Αν είσαι φοιτητής ή πρόσφατος απόφοιτος πληροφορικής στην Ελλάδα, μάλλον έχεις παρατηρήσει κάτι: **ο τίτλος σου δεν είναι αρκετός**.

Μπορείς να λύνεις αλγορίθμους. Καταλαβαίνεις data structures. Πέρασες τις εξετάσεις. Αλλά όταν βλέπεις job postings από εταιρείες του εξωτερικού—ή ακόμα και από μεγάλες ελληνικές tech εταιρείες—καταλαβαίνεις ότι κάτι λείπει.

## Το Χάσμα που Κανείς δεν Μιλάει

Τα πανεπιστήμια διδάσκουν **computer science**. Η αγορά χρειάζεται **software engineering**.

Να τι εννοώ:

### Τι Διδάσκει το Πανεπιστήμιο:
- Αλγόριθμους και complexity
- Θεωρητικά θεμέλια
- Ακαδημαϊκή επίλυση προβλημάτων
- Ατομικές εργασίες

### Τι Χρειάζεται η Αγορά:
- Κατασκευή production συστημάτων
- Δουλειά με existing codebases
- Team collaboration
- Git, CI/CD, testing
- Communication skills

**Το χάσμα είναι πραγματικό.** Και οι περισσότεροι φοιτητές το ανακαλύπτουν με τον δύσκολο τρόπο—μετά από δεκάδες απορρίψεις.

## Η Δική μου Ιστορία

Αποφοίτησα με καλούς βαθμούς. Μπορούσα να λύνω LeetCode mediums. Νόμιζα ότι ήμουν έτοιμος.

**Έκανα λάθος.**

Οι πρώτες μου 20 αιτήσεις; Απορρίψεις. Δεν καταλάβαινα καν γιατί.

Μετά το κατάλαβα: Ήξερα να κάνω code, αλλά δεν ήξερα πώς να κάνω **engineering**.

- Δεν ήξερα πώς να δομήσω ένα πραγματικό project
- Το GitHub μου έμοιαζε με νεκροταφείο μισοτελειωμένων tutorials
- Δεν μπορούσα να εξηγήσω τη δουλειά μου σε interviews
- Δεν είχα portfolio που να δείχνει πραγματικά skills

Οπότε πέρασα 6 μήνες μαθαίνοντας με τον δύσκολο τρόπο:
- Έφτιαξα ένα πραγματικό project (όχι todo app)
- Έμαθα Git σωστά
- Εξασκήθηκα σε system design
- Ξαναέγραψα το CV μου 15 φορές
- Έκανα mock interviews με φίλους

**Μετά όλα άλλαξαν.** Μέσα σε 2 μήνες, είχα 3 προσφορές από εταιρείες στο Λονδίνο.

## Τι Πραγματικά Μετράει

Αφού δούλεψα στο industry και έκανα mentor 50+ developers, αυτό έμαθα:

### 1. Φτιάξε Πραγματικά Projects
Όχι tutorials. Όχι courses. **Πραγματικά projects** που λύνουν πραγματικά προβλήματα.

Το GitHub σου πρέπει να δείχνει:
- Production-quality code
- Σωστή project structure
- Tests
- Documentation
- Deployed applications

### 2. Master τα Fundamentals
Όχι θεωρία—**engineering fundamentals**:
- Πώς να δομήσεις code
- Πώς να δουλέψεις με APIs
- Πώς να κάνεις debug αποτελεσματικά
- Πώς να χρησιμοποιήσεις Git σε team
- Πώς να γράψεις tests

### 3. Μάθε να Επικοινωνείς
Τα tech interviews δεν είναι coding tests. Είναι **συζητήσεις**.

Πρέπει να:
- Εξηγήσεις τη σκέψη σου
- Κάνεις clarifying questions
- Συζητήσεις trade-offs
- Συνεργαστείς σε λύσεις

### 4. Χτίσε το Brand σου
Οι εταιρείες δεν προσλαμβάνουν μόνο skills—προσλαμβάνουν **ανθρώπους**.

Η online παρουσία σου μετράει:
- Professional GitHub
- Καλογραμμένο CV
- LinkedIn που λέει την ιστορία σου
- Portfolio που δείχνει τη δουλειά σου

## Το Μονοπάτι Μπροστά

Η αλήθεια: **δεν χρειάζεσαι άλλο ένα πρόγραμμα που διδάσκει React**.

Χρειάζεσαι:
- **Structured guidance** για το τι να φτιάξεις
- **Real feedback** στον κώδικα και τα projects σου
- **Industry mentorship** από ανθρώπους που έχουν περάσει από εκεί
- **Interview preparation** που πραγματικά δουλεύει

Γι' αυτό φτιάξαμε το DevReady.

## Τι Μπορείς να Κάνεις Σήμερα

1. **Διάλεξε ΕΝΑ project** και φτιάξε το σωστά
2. **Push στο GitHub** καθημερινά
3. **Κάνε αίτηση σε 5 εταιρείες** (ακόμα κι αν νιώθεις "not ready")
4. **Συνδέσου με engineers** στο LinkedIn
5. **Μοιράσου την πρόοδό σου** δημοσίως

Το ταξίδι από φοιτητής σε engineer δεν είναι εύκολο. Αλλά είναι απολύτως εφικτό.

**Δεν χρειάζεται να είσαι perfect. Χρειάζεται να είσαι ready.**
