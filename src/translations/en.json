Whether you're a React developer, Python backend engineer, Java developer, mobile developer, or anything else — the skills we teach (engineering thinking, clean code, Git, interviewing, branding) apply universally to any tech role."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need prior coding experience?",
        "answer": "Yes, but nothing fancy. If you have the following basics, you're ready:\n\n• Variables and data types\n• Control flow\n• Loops\n• Functions and parameters\n• Basic understanding of one programming language\n\nWe focus on bridging the gap from 'I can code' to 'I'm industry-ready,' not teaching programming from scratch.\n\nWhat does 'basic knowledge' mean? You should be able to write simple programs and understand basic error messages. Think: solved some coding challenges, completed a beginner tutorial, or built a small personal project."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I get a job after the accelerator?",
        "answer": "We can't guarantee job placement, but we equip you with the exact skills, portfolio, and interview preparation that dramatically increase your chances. Many of our students found jobs within the next month. Your success depends on your effort and commitment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the time commitment?",
        "answer": "Expect ~2-3 hours per week of live sessions. The other ~5 hours are from your personal effort (project work and independent learning)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many people will be in my cohort?",
        "answer": "Maximum 15 people per cohort. This small size ensures we can provide targeted, personalized care and address your specific needs throughout the program."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this accelerator remote?",

        "question": "What if I miss a live session?",

      {
        "question": "Is this only for people looking for jobs in Greece?",

No one had taught them how the industry actually works, how to interview, or how to present themselves. So they helped each other, started their careers in Greece, learned the hard way, and eventually managed to land roles abroad.",
